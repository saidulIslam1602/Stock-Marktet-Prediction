# Stock-Marktet-Prediction
In this project, I forecast the stock price by creating an artificial neural network called Long Short Term Memory. An exploratory data analysis is done using Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib Library of Python Programming Language and an artificial neural network named LSTM is build to predict the stock.
